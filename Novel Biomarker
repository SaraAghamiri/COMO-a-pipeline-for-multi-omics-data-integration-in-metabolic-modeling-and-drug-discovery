Methods and Results Summary
Here is a breakdown of the methods used and their corresponding results:

1. Data Sources and Analysis
Methods:

Data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)-GBM dataset was analyzed using bioinformatics tools such as UCSC Xena, GEPIA, TIMER 2.0, and TISIDB.
Gene expression and immune cell distribution were explored using RNA-sequencing data.
Differential gene expression (DEG) analysis and Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) were performed to identify pathways enriched in MAP17-high vs. MAP17-low groups.
Results:

MAP17 was identified as a key marker associated with the slow-cycling glioblastoma phenotype, characterized by quiescence, stemness, and therapy resistance.
Enrichment of mesenchymal and stem-cell-related pathways was observed in MAP17-high groups.
MAP17 was also associated with immune processes, such as immune checkpoint inhibitors and antigen presentation.
2. Survival Analysis
Methods:

Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was conducted to compare overall survival (OS), disease-specific survival (DSS), and progression-free intervals (PFI) between high and low MAP17 groups.
Results:

High MAP17 expression correlated with worse OS, DSS, and PFI, highlighting its prognostic value.
3. Immune Microenvironment and Pathway Analysis
Methods:

Immune cell distribution was analyzed using TISIDB.
The STRING database was utilized for protein-protein interaction and pathway enrichment analysis.
Cytokine signaling pathways were explored using Hallmark and Reactome analyses.
Results:

MAP17-high tumors showed an immunosuppressive microenvironment enriched in immune checkpoint inhibitors (e.g., PD-L1, TIM3, CTLA-4).
The tumors also exhibited pathways related to IFN-Î³ signaling, antigen presentation, and inflammation.
4. Histological Validation
Methods:
Immunohistochemistry data from the Human Protein Atlas was used to visualize MAP17 expression in GBM tissues.
Results:
High MAP17 expression was predominantly observed in mesenchymal glioblastoma subtypes.
5. Metabolic Pathways
Methods:

Analysis of metabolic pathways enriched in MAP17-high groups, focusing on folate, zinc, and fatty acid metabolism.
Expression levels of transporters involved in these pathways were evaluated.
Results:

MAP17 was strongly associated with metabolic pathways critical for the quiescent stem-like phenotype of glioblastoma cells.
